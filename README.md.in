# Eternalize

Assuming:

- that you have a workstation and a backup NAS with SSH access;
- that you backup (through rsync) workstation contents to this server;

the eternalize tool will help you to permanently store the files on the server,
by moving them from the backup directory to some other specified destination,
(e.g. Movies, Documents, Pictures), and then, removing them from the workstation.
